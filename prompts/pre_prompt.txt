You are a cypher expert i need you to create for me a cypher json
format so i can create nodes in neo4j from the next article.
You need to focus on legal problems and corruption.
each node must have at least name and description.
The nodes should be only with the following types:
person, 
organization
event
you should connect those nodes with relationships  which holds summary on the connection
for exmaple , this is how the data should be returned so i can then json parse it,return the data in this stracture: 
[
"CREATE (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi', role:'Prime Minister of India', tenure:'2014-present', emphasis:'Anti-Corruption'})",
"CREATE (digitalIndia:Event {description:'Digital India initiative aims to minimize human intervention enhance transparency and improve efficiency in governance'})",
"CREATE (jamTrinity:Event {description:'JAM Trinity - Jan Dhan Aadhar Mobile - facilitates Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) eliminating fraud'})",
"CREATE (preventionOfCorruptionAct1988:Organization {summary:'Amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 strengthened anti-corruption measures'})",
"CREATE (blackMoneyAct:Organization {summary:'The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act 2015 targets illicit wealth'})",
"CREATE (benamiPropertyAct:Organization {summary:'Benami Property Act empowers government to combat corruption by targeting illegally held properties'})",
"CREATE (fugitiveEconomicOffendersAct:Organization {summary:'Fugitive Economic Offenders Act aims at confiscating assets of economic offenders who flee the country'})",
"CREATE (cpgrams:Organization {summary:'Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) allows citizens to lodge grievances'})",
"CREATE (gem:Event {description:'Government e-marketplace (GeM) ensures transparent public procurement via e-bidding'})",
"CREATE (pmSvanidhi:Event {description:'PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) aids street vendors enhancing informal employment'})",
"MATCH (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi'}) MATCH (digitalIndia:Event {description:'Digital India initiative aims to minimize human intervention enhance transparency and improve efficiency in governance'}) CREATE (modi)-[:LAUNCHED]->(digitalIndia)",
"MATCH (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi'}) MATCH (jamTrinity:Event {description:'JAM Trinity - Jan Dhan Aadhar Mobile - facilitates Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) eliminating fraud'}) CREATE (modi)-[:ENDORSED]->(jamTrinity)",

"MATCH (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi'}) MATCH (blackMoneyAct:Organization {summary:'The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act 2015 targets illicit wealth'}) CREATE (modi)-[:ENACTED]->(blackMoneyAct)",

"MATCH (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi'}) MATCH (gem:Event {description:'Government e-marketplace (GeM) ensures transparent public procurement via e-bidding'}) CREATE (modi)-[:INTRODUCED]->(gem)",
"MATCH (modi:Person {name:'Narendra Modi'}) MATCH (pmSvanidhi:Event {description:'PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) aids street vendors enhancing informal employment'}) CREATE (modi)-[:SUPPORTED]->(pmSvanidhi)"
]
IMPORTANT: when you are creating relationship make sure that you only use nodes that you created, so the neo4j can procces the data.(use the reffrences that you used on the nodes)
remove any apostrophes from the data. each one of the 's remove and use only s.
return the data as a string and NOT AS A CODE BLOCK JUST AS STRING.
return the data without any comments in a single line. the data has to be parseable json , so if you notice symbols or unneeded qoutes remove them.
