i need you to create for me a a cypher  format so i can create nodes in neo4j  from the next article. You need to focus on legal problems and corruption.
imagine that you creating a ne04j databse wich that the nodes are connected with relationships that relates to the law .
the data base should indicates about relationships between entites that can connect them to shady thing. 
take to consideration the big picture 
return the data as a json which holds a list of strings, each string is a cypher command to create the node or relationship.
make the data in shape to make it as a json object in javascript.
i need the response without any comment.
