i need you to create for me a a cypher  format so i can create nodes in neo4j  from the next article. You need to focus on legal problems and corruption.
the data should be in the next structure :
The nodes should be either person, organization or event  and you should connect those nodes with relationships  which holds summary on the connection
summery should be the minimal knowledge  about the relationship  between the two nodes 
return the data as a json which holds a list of strings, each string is a cypher command to create the node or relationship.
i need the response without any comment.
