"New India Innovates, Initiates and Implements. New India is no longer ready to accept that corruption is part of the system. It wants its systems transparent, processes efficient and governance smooth." - Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Before Narendra Modi assumed office as Prime Minister, India's economy suffered from policy paralysis, crony capitalism, opaque transactions, widespread corruption and inefficiency in governance.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure has been marked by significant legislative reforms, technological interventions, and institutional strengthening to enhance transparency and accountability in governance. From punitive actions targeting corruption to proactive measures and initiatives aimed at improving transparency, PM Modi's government has ushered in a new era of governance characterized by a commitment to integrity and efficiency. But when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, he instilled accountability and curbed corrupt practices. The PM sought to address the prevalent challenges by streamlining processes and leveraging e-governance to ensure efficient service delivery and timely grievance resolution.

Preventive Measures Against Corruption

One of the most impactful reforms introduced by the Modi government is Digital India, which aims to minimize human intervention, enhance transparency, and improve efficiency in governance. Leveraging the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan, Aadhar, Mobile), Digital India has facilitated the implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), which has been a game-changer, with over 104 crore beneficiaries receiving benefits directly in their accounts, resulting in estimated savings of Rs. 2.7 lakh crore from improper appropriation. Furthermore, JAM Trinity has helped identify and eliminate nearly 11 crore ghost and fraudulent beneficiaries of government schemes.

Another key initiative was the Amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, which provided more teeth to anti-corruption agencies and enhanced the penalties for corrupt practices. Strengthening laws such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and abolishing interviews for recruitment in government positions have minimized opportunities for corruption and ensured merit-based selection processes. Digitization initiatives, including e-filing, e-assessment, and faceless assessments, have reduced human interface, thereby mitigating the scope for corruption. Implementing e-auctions of natural resources has enhanced transparency in fund transfer and resource allocation, eliminating intermediaries and curbing corruption.

Punitive Measures Against Corruption

The enactment of critical legislations such as the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, and the Benami Property Act, along with the establishment of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Black Money, underscores the Modi government's commitment to tackle illicit financial activities. These efforts have resulted in the initiation of numerous cases and the recovery of substantial amounts of black money.

Introducing the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act aimed at confiscating assets of economic offenders who flee the country and the compulsory retirement of errant government officials through Rule 56(j) in the CCS (Pension) Rule have further strengthened the government's resolve to combat corruption.

Improving Transparency and Accountability

Centralized platforms like the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) have allowed citizens to lodge grievances. The government e-marketplace (GeM) has streamlined public procurement and eliminated cronyism and corruption through transparent bidding processes. The introduction of e-governance and online bidding/tendering systems has streamlined procedures and minimized opportunities for corruption in public procurements, ensuring fair and competitive practices and transparent resource allocation.

Another significant shift introduced by the Modi government was the adoption of dashboards to provide real-time operational data from various ministries and departments. This move centralized authentic information, reducing reliance on piecemeal reports and curbing data manipulation for political gain. It fostered transparency, accountability, and discipline in data reporting, preventing underperformance or leakages benefitting policymakers and the public. Additionally, the government has taken decisive action against corrupt officials, retiring several income tax and customs officers on corruption charges.

Furthermore, initiatives like the One Nation One Ration Card plan and the Digital India Land Record Modification Program have leveraged technology to enhance service delivery, reduce corruption, and empower citizens. The shift towards e-office systems and supply chain management of food grains has further facilitated transparent and efficient governance practices, leaving little room for malpractice.

Conclusion

The Modi government's transformative efforts to combat corruption from the corridors of power and enhance transparency across various sectors have been remarkable. By minimizing human intervention, employing stringent penalties for bribery, and embracing technology-driven solutions, the government has empowered the poor and marginalized, reducing their dependence on intermediaries and ensuring transparent and accountable service delivery.

As India continues on its development path, PM Narendra Modi's anti-corruption efforts stand as a testament to the nation's commitment to promote accountability in public service.

"Building Atmanirbhar Bharat Through Comprehensive Job Creation"
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
One of the most effective pathways of aspirational and practical self-actualization for citizens of a nation is employment generation at scale and expanse. Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government has been cognizant of this need and has moved the needle comprehensively so that job creation today is happening across the spectrum: in the formal and informal sectors, through direct and indirect opportunities, in conventional and unconventional fields, and via self-employment and the opening up of multiple avenues for gigs, start-ups and novel entrepreneurship.


Government Initiatives
If on the one hand, Bharat is seeing the exponential growth in the number of start-ups and a conducive environment has made it one that has the largest number of unicorns, on the other hand a record number of Mudra loans sanctioned have fuelled unprecedented women-led growth, and the Agniveer scheme that aims to recruit youth into the Armed services has seen adoption in record numbers. According to a Harvard University research, India is among the top quartile of fastest-growing countries till 2029 and is undergoing a historic transition towards becoming a more formalized and technologically advanced, digitally evolved nation.


In the three years between 2017-18 and 2020-21, total employment increased by 8.4 crore which is a manifestation of several key factors such as demonetisation, rationalisation of taxes, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), digital inclusivity and digitisation of financial transactions, inclusion of skill development and vocational training in the National Education Policy, increasing the number of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), a fillip to the hitherto marginalized segments such as rural and tribal populace, and effective incentivization for a highly labour dominant unorganized sector. An example is how PM Street Vendor‚Äôs Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi), has benefitted more than 56 lakh rehri or street vendors from June 2020 to November 2023.


Formalisation
Immense positive impact can be seen in the nation‚Äôs formal employment sector. India is the 5th largest economy in the world with 1.12 crore net additional employment created between 2015 to 2018. This is a result of the confluence of progressive, pro-industry policy decisions, leveraging of advancements in technology, reforms to ease business investment, and a focus on skilling. An example of how this translates on the ground is that with the PM MUDRA Yojana More than 15 crore people have been employed in the MSME sector out of which 3.4 crore are women.


In the IT Industry alone, around 20 lakh people have been employed between 2013-14 and 2021-22. Indirectly, about 6.24 crore jobs were created between 2014 and 2019 in India‚Äôs digital economy. When it comes to a boost in employment generation across sectors, let‚Äôs take the example of tourism ‚Äì a revamped and increasingly attractive tourism and hospitality industry led to 1.9 crore indirect jobs being created in the tourism sector between 2017 and 2020. The overhaul in the hospitality sector has led to the creation of many such jobs directly, and indirectly; India is among the most visited countries in the world and has been experiencing a growing influx of tourists. This has led to business incentivization and a boost to local artisans, transport providers, and hotels and restaurants within the larger hospitality service industry. In Air transport alone, for every Rs. 100/- invested in the sector, 610 indirect jobs are generated.


Infromal Sectors
The winds of change can also be seen in the disruptive as well as informal sectors. Providing security and stability to the unconventional health and wellness, since 2014, about 5.65 lakh practitioners have been provided employment under Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH). The introduction of several new reforms, an increase in FDI, which have further helped in improving the ‚Äòease of doing business‚Äô along with low data costs, improvised processes and ready adoption have created a thriving new ecosystem for employment ‚Äì the gig and platform economy. Gig-economy jobs grew year-on-year by 13% and over 29.20 crore people have registered so far on the E-Shram portal. From 2016 to May 2022, ‚ÄòHunar Haat‚Äô has created employment avenues for over 10.5 lakh artisans and talented Vishwakarmas.


The continuing chain of beneficiaries in the government‚Äôs Gati shakti model include processes that act as catalysts for indirect job creation in sectors such as transport, logistics, mobility, food, consumer goods and manufacturing products. Up to 2021-22, 53,696 km of roadways were created which generated 21.8 crore man-days of employment. As mentioned before, round 6 crore people employed in unorganized sector between 2017-18 and 2019-20 have benefited from the SVANidhi Yojana ‚Äì making PM Modi‚Äôs vision of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Prayas a quintessential facet of employment for all.


People-first policies such as the flagship program for equitable housing, the PM Awas has created 2.39 crore indirect jobs up to 2022. Another great example of the ripple effect of employment generation can be seen in the form of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes which enable the expansion of existing industries into larger ones, while promoting the creation of new ones. As an example, 5 lakh incremental jobs have been created in the mobile manufacturing sector due to PLI. As per the Economic Survey 2023, PLI schemes are slated to create 60 lakh jobs. In addition, India‚Äôs fintech adoption rate of 87% as against the world average of 64% has enabled the creation of an ecosystem that is touching the lives and livelihoods of all ‚Äì including the self-employed and small business owners.


To this end, Rozgar Melas that aim to provide 10 lakh jobs in less than two years, and that meld employment opportunities and unique talent have been a boon for the economy. Rozgar Mela is a key step towards the fulfilment of the commitment to accord the highest priority to employment generation in the country. On 12th February, 2024, PM Modi distributed more than 1 lakh appointment letters to newly inducted recruits and also lay the foundation stone of Phase I of the Integrated Complex ‚ÄúKarmayogi Bhavan‚Äù to promote collaboration and synergy amongst various pillars of Mission Karmayogi. ‚ÄúRozgar Melas are playing a crucial role in enhancing the contribution of our Yuva Shakti in nation building‚Äù, said PM Modi. Rozgar Mela will be held at 47 locations across the country this year with recruitments taking place across central government departments and state governments/UTs supporting this initiative. These melas ascribe gainful opportunities to the youth, the Amrit Generation, and create pathways for their direct participation in national development. Similarly, under the Prime Ministers Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), over 43.77 lakh people have got employment and the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) has led to the placement of over 24.51 lakh candidates.


As policy making becomes efficient, so do its representative tools; more than 19.9 lakh people have been placed in jobs through employment exchanges between 2017-2022. The government has incessantly been taking many measures to tackle unemployment issues and stem the unemployment rate. The Amrit generation is benefitting from a multi-pronged approach; if on the one hand, Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI), has benefitted around 2.94 lakh from 2014-15 to December 2022, on the other hand, over 1.80 lakh new job-creators and entrepreneurs are now operating under the Stand-Up India scheme.


New India ‚Äì Naya Bharat ‚Äì is one that thrives on a developed mindset with the aim of making the country Atmanirbhar, and a Vishwa Mitra ‚Äì one the world leans on. As an example of this commitment, in the current financial year, Khadi has achieved a historic milestone by generating over 9.54 lakh new jobs. Be it our push towards renewable energy, creating a decarbonized energy sector which ranks India is 4th globally or the reduction of unemployment rate in rural areas, (decreased from 5.3% in 2017-18 to 2.4% in 2022-23) the commitment of PM Modi‚Äôs government to decisively mitigate unemployment stays foremost.


A spurt in the employment index is predicated on employment mobility to higher productivity jobs, rising job rates in secondary and tertiary sectors, promotion of women as economic catalysts and the increased formalisation of the unorganized, informal sector. PM Modi‚Äôs government has consistently come good on all the parameters which is the reason why milestone, upon milestone, Bharat‚Äôs journey towards becoming Atmanirbhar and the world‚Äôs third largest economy, is only a matter of time.

New Bharat Priorities Inclusion Development
February 24, 2024
Share

PM Quote
'We are here to serve people. Speaking of this period of service, a large portion of Bharat's population was deprived of basic amenities before we formed the government. Millions of impoverished individuals had given up hope that their lives would ever change. The attitude of previous governments was such that they considered themselves as the ultimate authority. We, however, started working not with a sense of authority but as servants, focusing on providing priority to those who were marginalized.'

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas approach of g9vernance has empowered every Indian, particularly Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the economically vulnerable ones. The government has successfully established a strong ecosystem for comprehensive empowerment, aligning with the inclusive development envisioned by Prime Minister Modi for people with low incomes and SCs.

Marginalized communities are now experiencing unprecedented levels of inclusion in mainstream society, thanks to the unwavering efforts of the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Whether it's honouring heroes from these sections in our fight for freedom or implementing economic initiatives, social justice and empowerment are finally reaching those who were previously ignored, oppressed, and deprived.

India, with the world's second-largest tribal population, is witnessing newfound recognition for its vibrant Janjatiya culture, unparalleled contributions during the freedom struggle, and outstanding service to the nation. Such initiatives were unheard or unseen before PM Modi took oath to his office. He has often been seen sporting traditional outfits, headdresses and products from tribal areas. Museums are being established in Gujarat, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Manipur, Mizoram and Goa etc. to showcase and preserve the memories of tribal freedom fighters.

Through the Mudra Yojana, over eight crore youngsters, including those from rural, poor, Dalit, backward, tribal, and deprived classes, have started their businesses, transforming their destinies. More than 75 % of the beneficiaries of the PM SVANidhi scheme are from the Dalit, backwards, and tribal communities. PM SVANidhi has ensured inclusive entrepreneurship by allocating 22% of the total disbursement to SCs/STs. Under the PMAY (G), 13 lakh+ houses are sanctioned to SC/ ST beneficiaries. The mantra of 'Vocal for Local' aided the economic upliftment of approximately 11 crore tribals and different communities, and it has become the basis of Developed India.

The commitment of the Modi government is evident in initiatives such as prioritizing their education with scholarships and reserved seats in educational institutions, along with implementing skill training programs and financial support schemes to boost economic opportunities. Promoting education in tribal areas is one major aim of this government. The government is setting up 740 Eklavya Residential Model Schools (EMRS) to serve 3.5 lakh tribal students with quality education. Scholarship for Higher Education for Young Achievers Scheme (SHREYAS), an umbrella scheme to ensure top-class education for SCs, has many components such as free coaching, overseas scholarships, etc. The scheme has been instrumental in empowering numerous individuals, with over 2300 crore rupees dedicated to educating SC and OBC students since 2014. It has particularly benefited over 21,000 SC students pursuing higher education.

Another vital move in this regard is the establishment of the Sammakka Sarakka Central Tribal University in Mulugu District, Telangana, as mandated by the Thirteenth Schedule of the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act, 2014 with allocation of Rs. 889 crore. The new university will boost research in tribal art, culture, and traditional knowledge, benefiting the tribal population by expanding education capacity and addressing regional disparities. It will ensure inclusivity, quality, cultural preservation, and empowerment, bridging regional education gaps.

To boost the financial empowerment of SCs, a Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojana (PM-AJAY), a 100% Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented in 2021-22 for skill development and infrastructure development, saw Rs. 1150 crore disbursed to the states for the transformation of villages predominantly inhabited by Scheduled Castes into Adarsh Gram. Stand-Up India promoted entrepreneurship at the grassroots level, focusing on economic empowerment and job creation for women, SCs, and STs. Since its inception to November 2023, 7000 crore+ loans have been sanctioned to 33,331 SC beneficiaries.

Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (JANMAN) was launched in November 2023 for a comprehensive development of 75 vulnerable tribal communities residing in 18 states and 1 UT with a total budget of Rs. 24,104 crore. The coverage will benefit about 28 lakh people living in about 22000 habitations in more than 800 blocks in 200 districts across India. This initiative targets 11 crucial interventions across nine ministries, and the announcement was made on Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas in Khunti, Jharkhand. The interventions include provision for Pucaa houses, road connectivity, piped water supply, mobile medical units and others. In addition, special emphasis has been given to imparting training for skill development. While 15 crore people benefitted from the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, in tribal areas particularly, screening for sickle cell anaemia crossed more than 50 lakh people. The Yatra's primary objective has been to raise awareness about the welfare schemes and policies of the Central government, aiming for 100% coverage of flagship government initiatives.

Such steps guide and illuminate the resurgence of New India and give the nation a new direction. It is a direction where enhancement, integration, advancement, and safeguarding of backward communities and their cultural heritage are uncompromising for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and their prosperity assured.

Bharat ‚Äì Towards Fostering Cultural Connectivity
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
Since assuming office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become a catalyst in bringing much-needed change in the cultural sphere, bringing different communities together and imbibing a sense of cultural pride in youth and old alike. There has been an unprecedented push towards the revival of ignored traditions and cultural values and the restoration of connectivity in the form of corridors and infrastructures under the leadership of the PM. The government under PM Modi has delivered on its promises by giving unwavering attention to the revival of our faith and culture by revamping once-neglected pilgrimage places and corridors.

The need for the revival and redevelopment of connectivity is driven by a multitude of factors, such as preserving one's identity and heritage, instil a sense of pride in India's cultural heritage and wisdom, reconnecting with roots, rekindling pride and patriotism, promoting cultural diplomacy, and boosting tourism and the economy.
The government has been making positive strides towards enhancing accessibility to pilgrimage places and corridors by developing infrastructure and encouraging religious tourism, which plays a significant role in creating jobs and upscaling the circular economy. The government has undertaken considerable infrastructure development projects to enhance connectivity, accessibility, and overall quality of life. These initiatives promote tourism, boost economic growth, and address the needs of the rapidly growing population. These infrastructure works collectively contribute to the socio-economic development of the region, making it more resilient, connected, and capable of meeting the needs of its residents and visitors.

In order to transform India into a world-class destination for spiritual tourism, the government under PM Modi has undertaken several redevelopment projects. Tourism initiatives such as the SWADESH DARSHAN and PRASHAD schemes have been taken to promote tourism by developing theme-based circuits.

One of the most notable initiatives is the PRASHAD scheme, which the Indian government launched through the Ministry of Tourism in 2014‚Äì2015. PRASHAD scheme stands for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation And Spiritual Augmentation Drive. This project focuses on establishing and identifying pilgrimage sites around India to boost the religious tourist experience. It strives to integrate pilgrimage places in a prioritised, planned and sustainable manner to deliver a holistic religious tourism experience.
The PRASHAD program aims to facilitate the growth and advancement of religious tourism in India. The main goal of the scheme is to improve pilgrimages and spiritual experiences for visitors by providing well-planned tourism infrastructure that allows for visitor comfort, accessibility, security, and cleanliness. To rejuvenate pilgrimages and heritage cities by preserving their souls through integrated, inclusive, and sustainable development that creates jobs for the local population.

Under the PRASHAD scheme, the Ministry offers financial support to Union Territory Administrations and State Governments to construct infrastructure at tourist attractions. The Ministry has approved 46 projects totalling Rs. 1629.17 crore to date. Furthermore, 26 additional locations have been identified for development under the PRASHAD Scheme.

While heritage cities are chosen based on their high heritage values, tourist traffic, number of monuments, and accreditations, pilgrimage destinations are selected based on pilgrimage lineage and pilgrim footfall.

From investing in infrastructural works, be it Roadways or Ropeways, or enhancing the connectivity through Char Dham Projects, the government has left no stone unturned to connect the once inaccessible terrains to the masses. This includes constructing and widening highways, bridges, and rural roads. Efforts have also been made to enhance and improve rail and air connectivity in Uttarakhand.

With the government embarking on this marvellous journey of restoring the lost glory to once forgotten cultural heritage and traditions, the people of the nation are getting connected to their roots again. Along with bringing an overhaul in the cultural and heritage development, the government has been successful in the revival of not just our traditions, heritage, and culture but also the creation of infrastructural landmarks and marvels simultaneously. Today, not only are the nation's citizens in awe of their restored cultural heritage, but Bharat, triumphantly, has managed to put herself on the global cultural pedestal where the whole world is taking note of her ever-evolving nature.

Aspirational Districts for Aspirational India
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads India with the determination to treasure and capitalize on unity in diversity and create a developed Bharat @2047 that is second to none and uniquely positioned globally. He has often affirmed during his address to the nation that he aims to shape a Bharat with the support of 140 crore Indians steeped in social justice so that our future generations do not have to struggle for small things and no one is left behind.

In 2014, many nation regions lagged in development even after many decades of Independence. While many of the nation‚Äôs hundreds of districts continued to advance, the less developed districts continued to regress. In order to bridge this gap, the Aspirational Districts Program (ADP) was launched on January 5, 2018. ADP is ‚Äòaligned to the approach of ‚Äúleave no one behind‚Äù‚Äîthe vital core of the Sustainable Development Goals. Certain districts have been designated as ‚ÄúAspirational Districts‚Äù by NITI Aayog. These districts were chosen using a composite measure that takes into account published deprivation data from the Socio-Economic Caste Census, Basic Infrastructure, Health, Nutrition, Education, Agriculture, Water Resources, Financial Inclusion and Skill Development.

The States are the primary forces behind the Aspirational Districts Programme. NITI Aayog serves as the program‚Äôs anchor at the Government of India level. District plans are created using a broad framework created by NITI Aayog. District Administration receives a primer outlining actions to be followed to enhance each of the indicators developed based on input from the relevant ministries. Districts are urged to modify the template because every district faces unique opportunities and difficulties. They have been specifically instructed to recognise low-hanging fruits and opportunities and develop a plan of action to take advantage of them.

With a transparent process, the Transformation of Aspirational Districts Program seeks to quickly and transparently transform 112 districts selected from 28 states. The three main components of the program are district collector competition, district and central ‚ÄúPrabhari‚Äù officers‚Äô cooperation, and the convergence of central and state schemes. This project, which is mostly driven by the States and implemented for the benefit of the States, ranks the chosen districts based on progress made, highlights the positive aspects of each district, and determines the feasible goals for immediate improvement.

Over the past decade, the Central Government‚Äôs initiative to improve the district‚Äôs economic and social development status and scale up the bureaucracy‚Äôs efficiency has yielded tangible results. Postings in aspirational areas are no longer considered inferior by civil servants. The Aspirational Districts (ADs) have outperformed non-ADs, according to a comparison with their counterparts. In the areas of health, nutrition, and financial inclusion, 5.8% more pregnant women with severe anaemia received treatment; 4.8% more children with diarrhoea diagnoses received treatment; 4.5% more pregnant women enrolled in antenatal care during their first trimester; 9.6% more home deliveries got attended by a skilled birth attendant.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantra Suraksha Bima Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, there were 406 and 847 more enrolments, and 1580 more accounts opened per 1 lakh population, respectively than the non-ADs. Additionally, the UNDP research suggests the ‚ÄúMalaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyaan‚Äù in Dantewada and Bijapur has decreased malaria incidences by 54% and 71%, respectively.

‚ÄúIn the first term, we kept filling the potholes of the previous governments, in the second term we laid the foundation of a new India, in the third term we will accelerate the development of a Viksit Bharat.‚Äù

The success of the Aspirational Districts Programme forms the basis of the Aspirational Blocks Programme. At the block level, the Aspirational Blocks Program aims to improve the quality of life for its residents, raise the standard of living and strengthen governance in 500 Aspirational Blocks, which cover 329 districts in India. Encouraging a new governance mindset, a new culture of facilitating government services at citizen doorsteps and community participation, ‚ÄúChintan Shivirs‚Äù were arranged at the village and block levels to assist in the effective implementation of the Aspirational Block Program (ABP) to create strong block development strategies. In this regard, ‚ÄúSankalp Saptaah‚Äù were observed in all 500 aspirational blocks starting from September 2023.

The Aspirational Districts Program demonstrates that when a government sets goals and encourages a progressive work culture, amazing things happen on the ground. Due to collaborative efforts inside the districts, the aspirational districts are developing faster than the national average. United Nations Development Program (UNDP) hails India‚Äôs Aspirational District Program (ADP) as a fantastic example of local area development. Other countries that have fallen behind in their growth are recommended to embrace this approach adopted by the Modi government.

"I take all my decisions through the prism of Nation First" - PM Narendra Modi.

Over the last ten years, India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has undergone profound transformations across the board. The incredible work that the Prime Minister has done for the country will be remembered for generations to come. Narendra Modi will be remembered for his punctuality, hard work and detailed study. He is an icon of development, and his forceful stand on development has earned him a separate space in the political field. PM Modi's unwavering faith in his ideals, passion for the country, and love for his fellow citizens are unprecedented. Narendra Modi is the strongest PM India has ever had. PM Modi is the best speaker and the most popular leader in the world. He is the only prime minister who has made several bold decisions and succeeded in them, too.

A firm believer in 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat, PM Modi is committed to national integration. As a result of the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the erstwhile State of Jammu-Kashmir, the Union territories of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh have been fully integrated into the nation's mainstream. The Modi government's momentous decision of 2019, unanimously upheld by the Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, resulted in a considerable decline in separatism, recruitment of locals into militancy, terror activities, and nepotism. Talent is blooming in India's Kashmir valley. The prime minister is fulfilling the dreams of people in Jammu and Kashmir, which have been unfulfilled for the past 70 years. Gulf countries are investing in Jammu & Kashmir. An era of bomb blasts has been replaced by development by the Modi government.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has secured respect for India's cultural heritage on the world stage with the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Ram Mandir is not merely realizing a long-cherished dream for millions of Hindus but also a symbol of unity and inclusivity. The Mandir is a testament to the revival of India's rich cultural heritage. The intricate architecture and craftsmanship pay homage to the ancient traditions and architectural brilliance of the country's past, showcasing the timeless beauty of Indian artistry ignored and neglected for several decades. The global community has taken notice of the Pran Pratishta, a historic event on Jan 22, 2024, by the Prime Minister, emphasizing the importance of religious freedom, cultural preservation, and the celebration of diversity. The Ram Mandir would remain a beacon of inspiration for those who appreciate the significance of historical and cultural landmarks. The temple's grandeur reflects the shared cultural heritage and values that bind the diverse communities of India.

PM Modi strongly believes India can move forward only by respecting, empowering and making women feel equal. A revolutionary change is being felt in the country's social life as the country is moving with a vision of women-led development. India scripted history with the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill or Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam in Parliament. Achieving a critical mass of 30 per cent representation by women in Parliament is known to yield positive outcomes for women's empowerment across the globe. The bill will ensure that women occupy at least 33 per cent of the seats in state legislative assemblies and the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. It will enable greater participation of women in policymaking and equitable governance at the state and national levels. Including women will give the vast majority of the population a voice in how their lives should be run.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has changed people's approach towards border villages. While previous governments ignored the development of border areas as they feared enemies might enter our country. They had a strange logic that if they developed border areas, the enemy would penetrate the country using these routes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made the development of border villages as his government's priority. While earlier governments called such areas the last villages, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called them the first villages. Today, the 'Vibrant Villages Programme' is improving the standard of living of the people of the border villages and encouraging them to stay in their places, preventing migration from these villages and also strengthening the security of the border. With this changed vision, people visiting the border area know Kibithoo in Arunachal Pradesh is not the last village but the first village in India.

As he took over as Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi immediately launched the Digital India Mission. The mission was, in a way, a reaffirmation of his commitment to empowering ordinary Indians with technology. India added more than 50 crore people to banking who did not have bank accounts, and as a result, India has moved far ahead in fintech and digital payments. UPI(Unified Payment Interface) become a huge success, as India clocks 46 % of global digital transactions. Following the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, India emphasized the approach of last-mile delivery and saturation. The saturation approach meant no beneficiary would be left out. It eliminated discrimination and corruption. The digital identity led India to develop the DBT system. With the help of this system, 400 billion dollars has been transferred to beneficiaries in the last ten years, eliminating the scope for corruption and saving more than 33 billion dollars of the country from falling into the wrong hands. As a result, India lifted 250 million people out of poverty.


India has expanded its tax base to more than double ever since the introduction of GST in July 2017. The Goods and Services Tax, enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, subsumed 17 local levies, such as excise duty, service tax, and value-added tax, and 13 other charges, making India a hot spot of Foreign Direct Investment, 'Bright Spot' in the global economy and a key contributor to the growth of the world economy. India has outperformed its global peers in economic growth and has become the fifth-largest economy under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is poised to become the third largest by 2026.


PM gave the slogan 'Start Up India, Stand Up India,' which made India the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. India made history as it became the first nation to successfully land on the Moon's southern pole with the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The success of Moon Mission, Tiranga, and Shiv Shakti Point has been hailed as a new centre of inspiration for the future generation of Indians.


On the foreign policy front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has transformed the contours of New Delhi's engagements with the world. Today, the world wants to know what India is thinking. India has befriended Gulf Arabs more aggressively than in the past. Within a short span of nine years, India has established visible political engagements with all the countries of the broader Middle East. Today, policymakers and analysts in India have used expressions such as 'civilizational links', 'historic ties', 'ancient connections', 'strategic proximity' and 'extended neighbourhood' to describe the Indo-Gulf relations. These are not catchphrases but reflect centuries-old reality ignored by the previous governments.

Among the many firsts that PM Modi has done for India is the successful isolation of Pakistan in the International arena, which resulted in the near end of militancy in Kashmir. Narendra Modi started taking action to expose Pakistan's involvement in Kashmir immediately after becoming Prime Minister. PM in 2014 did international exposure of Pakistan's link with extremists from the soil of Beijing, a foreign country and a close ally of Pakistan. During his maiden visit to UAE, an Islamic country, in August 2015, both countries, in their joint statement, condemned extremism, including States that use religion to support and sponsor terrorism against other

countries. The placing of Pakistan under the FATF Grey List in 2018 was, to a great extent, due to the exposure of misdeeds in Pakistan to the whole world by PM Modi. In 2019, India announced that it would "completely isolate" Pakistan after a suicide attack killed 46 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.

The actions taken by PM Modi have started showing results now. India's neighbours, leading Islamic countries and all big powers agree to the points made by PM Narendra Modi on Pakistan. Pakistan is politically, socially and economically in dire straits, and other countries also marginalize them.

The Global North dominated the international system, which was also reflected in the composition of the G20 grouping before the Delhi summit in 2023. However, under its G20 presidency, India did something unique. PM Modi made a strong case by including the voices of countries not in the G20 group. The African Union was made a permanent member of the G20 grouping under New Delhi's presidency, making the grouping, in the words of Narendra Modi, "inclusive and human-centric." Leaders worldwide lauded the PM initiative as India became the 'Voice of the Global South.'

The United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations have all praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to combat poverty, development of Digital Public Infrastructure, Covid Vaccination program and VaccineMaitri, women empowerment, and inclusive economic growth.

Aatmanirbhar Bharat: A Journey to Self Reliance
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
On May 13, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a national address , where he spoke of the economic challenges facing India due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unveiled a substantial economic package worth ‚Çπ20 lakh crore to rejuvenate the Indian economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon the citizens to participate in the mission of building a self-reliant India, often referred to as an "Aatma Nirbhar" nation, by not only supporting local businesses but also by actively promoting them. PM Modi remarked ‚ÄúWhen India speaks of self-reliance it does not speak of self-centred system,In India‚Äôs self-reliance there is a concern for the whole world‚Äôs happiness, cooperation and peace‚Äù.

To give necessary thrust on Aatmanirbhar Bharat, the government had allocated Rs 1.97 lakh crore for in the Union Budget 2021-22 across 14 sectors. The primary goal of was to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities and boost exports.


As of September 2023, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for 14 sectors, such as electronics, telecommunication, pharma, white goods, and textiles, have successfully attracted investments totalling over Rs 1 lakh crore.

The Commerce and Industry Ministry disclosed that, until November 2023, 746 applications had been approved under these schemes.

PLI units have been established in more than 150 districts across 24 states. The ministry highlighted that these schemes have resulted in direct and indirect employment for over 6.4 lakh individuals, contributing to production/sales amounting to Rs 7.80 lakh crore.

In the fiscal year 2022-23, incentives worth approximately Rs 2,900 crore have been disbursed. The statement also emphasised a 20% increase in mobile manufacturing over the past three years, with notable achievements in import substitution in the telecom and pharma sectors.

Within the white goods sector, 64 companies have been selected under the PLI scheme. Among them, 34 companies have invested Rs 5,429 crore in air conditioner components, and 30 companies have invested Rs 1,337 crore in LED component manufacturing.

Furthermore, the scheme is anticipated to attract additional investments of Rs 6,766 crore, creating an additional 48,000 jobs. Notably, 13 foreign companies are expected to invest Rs 2,090 crore in this endeavour.

One of the key success stories of the PLI scheme has been the production shift by Apple from China.

In a notable achievement for the Modi government's "Make in India" initiative and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Apple has successfully assembled iPhones with a freight-on-board (FOB) value surpassing Rs 60,000 crore in the initial seven months of the fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24) through its India-based suppliers.

This accomplishment represents 81% of their combined target of Rs 74,000 crore, a requirement under the PLI scheme for mobile devices in FY24. Notably, 70% of this achievement is attributed to iPhone exports from India. The data is sourced from Apple's three vendors - Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron (now owned by Tatas) - provided to both the Centre and state governments, and as reported by Business Standard.

The Free On Board (FOB) value, including the ex-factory cost and additional expenses like transportation and warehousing, has shown impressive performance. Based on current trends, the three suppliers are projected to reach an FOB value of Rs 90,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore in iPhone production by the end of FY24. This represents a substantial increase of 20 to 35% compared to their commitments under the PLI scheme.

If the three vendors achieve this goal, they would comfortably surpass the FOB value target of Rs 92,526 crore for FY25. Looking ahead, the aim for the fifth year is to reach Rs 1.09 lakh crore, facilitating Apple's plan to shift 18-20% of its iPhone production to India by FY26.

In the first seven months of FY24, the three vendors achieved an FOB value closely matching Apple's entire FY23 performance, totalling Rs. 62,000 crore. Even in the second year of operations, Apple exceeded its commitment under the scheme, producing iPhones with an FOB value of Rs 47,000 crore against the committed Rs 62,000 crore.

The significant surge in the FOB value of iPhone production this year is attributed to a substantial increase in iPhone exports from India. Exports reached $5 billion (Rs 41,700 crore) in the initial seven months of FY24, marking a remarkable 177% growth year-on-year. In comparison, during the same period last year, iPhone exports from India amounted to only $1.8 billion.

Consequently, Apple's share in the total exports of mobile devices from India has seen a substantial rise, increasing from 45% in FY23 to 62.5% within the initial seven months of FY24. This positive trend has prompted the government to set ambitious targets, with Communications Minister Ashwani Vaishnaw announcing a goal of reaching $15 billion in mobile device exports from India and an overall production value of $50 billion within the country by the end of the financial year 2024.

What has also worked for the PLI, as an external factor, is the slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has increased labour costs and left many manufacturers worried about the ambiguity in policy making, as witnessed during the Covid-zero lockdowns.

Modi Government‚Äôs Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme had its origins in the Covid-19 pandemic, as India finally aimed for atma nirbharta in the manufacturing sector. Contrary to what some critics have been claiming, the PLI programme is critical in ushering a manufacturing ecosystem in the country, which will also help micro, small, and medium enterprises in the long run. From assembling in the first stage, the country will soon be a key player in the manufacturing of components, thus integrating it in the global supply chain and consequently, the economy.

Enabling Middle Class in Modi's India: A Paradigmatic Shift
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, the government has strongly emphasised creating a framework to help the impoverished escape poverty and ensure their advancement is long-lasting since 2014. At the same time, initiatives have been taken to build a growth-friendly environment that enables those in poverty to rise to the middle class while accommodating their evolving goals. Consequently, the middle class in India has grown into a driving force behind the country's progress.

There is no specific definition for the middle class. However, in the Indian scenario, the middle class is considered to have the most hard-working and consistent attitude. The rage of the Indian middle class was visible on various platforms before 2014. Their aspiration to live a better life is realised with multiple efforts by the current government. Before 2014, due importance was not given to the betterment of the middle class. The issues that affect the middle class, such as health, education, public transport, housing, etc., were missing from the priority list of the earlier governments. The PM Modi-led government's initiatives are gradually filling this gap in middle-class-centric governance. In the last decade, a host of initiatives and structural changes have immensely improved the living standard of Madhyam Varg.

The lower personal income tax rates have been one of the government's most significant initiatives under PM Modi. Recent Union Budgets have implemented several tax reforms to assist middle-class taxpayers. Individuals can now pay less taxes and retain more of their hard-earned money due to the adoption of lower tax slabs and a simplified tax structure, and they can use it for education and skill enhancement. Measures such as introducing GST in 2017 have eliminated the cascading impact of taxes. Moreover, the rebate limit for Personal Income Tax was raised to Rs. 7 lakh from Rs. 5 lakh in the new tax regime, leading to more savings for middle-class individuals. In fact, during the pandemic time, loans approved under the COVID-affected Sectors Loan Guarantee Scheme benefitted the Madhyam Varg.

Furthermore, the government has taken action to support job growth and entrepreneurship, which are crucial for the middle class to grow. Launching programmes like Make in India and Startup India intends to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). These programmes have encouraged middle-class members to pursue their dreams of becoming entrepreneurs and generating job opportunities. In addition, a reduction in compliance boosts the entrepreneurial spirit among them.

The middle class has traditionally believed they can rise to a more prosperous position through better education and government employment. Creating IITs, IIMs, and other higher education institutions has given them optimism. Over the past nine years, India has seen a rise in the number of prestigious universities. In the nine years prior, 353 new universities, seven new IITs, and seven new IIMs were founded. India has completely revolutionised its medical education system. Between 2014 and 2023, the number of medical colleges and AIIMS increased from 387 to 706 and 7 to 22, respectively. There has been a 112% surge in MBBS seats, rising from 51,348 in 2014 to 1,08,940 in 2023 and a 127% increase in PG seats, climbing from 31,185 in 2014 to 70,674 in 2023.

In addition, investments in digital infrastructure, connectivity, and transportation have all been given the utmost importance by the Modi government. Besides raising middle-class people's standard of living, these investments have opened up new opportunities for economic expansion and upward mobility. In addition, schemes like UDAN have benefited all middle-class sections. More than 2.50 lakh UDAN flights have helped more than 1.37 crore people by providing hassle-free travel. In addition, the expansion of the metro network, Vande Bharat trains, and Namo Bharat trains have ensured world-class travel for the Indian middle class.

Health plays a significant role in ensuring quality of life. PM Modi-led government has made medicines affordable through Janaushadhi Kendras, saving over Rs. 25,000 crore in the last ten years. In addition, the government has created a robust healthcare infrastructure that has ensured quality medical services for the middle class.

The middle class in India has played a significant role in the nation's advancement. Despite being overlooked in past government initiatives, their honest contribution to the economy as committed taxpayers is now gaining recognition. The much-anticipated interim budget of 2024 has been set to fulfil the dream of owning a house for every middle-class family. An exclusive housing scheme for the middle class will bring respite to 43 crore Indians who fall within this demographic. Moreover, reforms such as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 [RERA] have ensured security in the delivery of homes, ensuring and creating confidence in the housing sector.

The middle class has profited through the Modi government's policies regarding economic growth, social mobility, and overall well-being over the past decade. The government's commitment to bolstering the middle class and ensuring their sustained growth and prosperity in the years to come can be seen in its measures, ranging from tax reforms and affordable housing to healthcare, education, and entrepreneurship. The middle class's prosperity is essential to realising India's dream of becoming a global economic powerhouse, and the Modi government's initiatives in this area are vital to building a more resilient and inclusive society.

JAM Trinity Transforming Lives
February 24, 2024

Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
In 2014, when Narendra Modi assumed the role of Prime Minister of India, his foremost challenge wasn't merely the struggling economy but the imperative task of uniting the nation comprehensively. Despite decades of schemes aimed at facilitating public services, subsidies, and healthcare across the country, the supply chain consistently suffered leakages amounting to significant financial losses, disconnecting a substantial portion of the population.

The old political jibe of only 15 paise, for every rupee leaving the government coffers, reaching the poor haunted all welfare programmes in India. Beneficiaries were either missing, redundant, or non-existent, and thus, the middlemen availed the benefits and resources meant for the poor.

India grappled with inequality, especially as urban areas rapidly embraced digitization, leaving rural regions at risk of lagging behind. While cities adopted the latest technologies in communication, banking, finance, and medicine, the rural population faced financial exclusion, struggled with supply chain leakages, and often lacked verifiable identification.

Addressing the challenge of connecting 140 crore people required an astute starting point. In 1999, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) proposed a 'multi-purpose national identity card,' later refined by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) into the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in 2009. However, the idea needed strategic implementation.

This is where Aadhaar emerged as a pivotal element of the JAM trinity. By December 2014, over 720 million people had enrolled for Aadhaar cards, and by April 2018, nearly 120 crore Indians were covered, with several states achieving saturation ratios exceeding one.

Aadhaar played a crucial role in facilitating the opening of Jan Dhan accounts, addressing the longstanding issue of over 800 million rural residents excluded from the financial system. By December 2014, over a hundred million bank accounts were linked to Aadhaar, plugging leakages in subsidy transfers and empowering beneficiaries. The combination of Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts proved successful, with the financial year 2015 witnessing 3 lakh new Jan Dhan accounts and 5 lakh Aadhaar card enrollments daily. Today, the number of Jan Dhan Accounts exceeds 50 crore.

It must be noted that it was only under the Modi government where Aadhaar became a foundational identity. Unlike the Congress government, the Modi regime was quite bullish on the prospects of Aadhaar and the benefits it could usher. For instance, while the Congress discontinued the LPG DBT in January 2014, fearing an electoral backlash, the Modi government embarked on ensuring banking penetration for all through the Jan Dhan Yojana programme.

From a socio-economic perspective, Jan Dhan Yojana has been one of the biggest success stories of the Modi government. Not only it ensured financial inclusion in the rural areas, it also empowered the women who were earlier relying on cash, or lacked financial independence. By the end of 2023, the deposits in the Jan Dhan accounts exceeded Rs. 2.1 Lakh Crore, proving all naysayers wrong.

The third component, mobile phones, significantly enhanced the scalability of Jan Dhan and Aadhaar programs. With 600 million unique mobile phone users in the country, linking account numbers to Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts streamlined scalability, accessibility, and sustainability.

The JAM trinity, now the bedrock of digital governance in India, supports a multitude of government services, including housing, healthcare, subsidized fuel, banking, and direct benefit transfers. Initiatives like 'Pahal' for LPG subsidies and urea distribution have successfully reduced supply chain leakages.

In the ten years of the Modi Government, remarkable achievements have been witnessed which have been a result of the JAM trinity. For starters, 10 Crore fake beneficiaries have been eliminated from the system. Through Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs), Rs. 34 Lakh Crore have been transferred to over 100 Crore beneficiaries across hundreds of welfare programmes. These DBTs have ensured a comprehensive development of the rural micro ecosystem.

The importance of JAM Trinity must also be seen in the context of the pandemic. From cash transfers to women to foodgrain allotment under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, none of it would have been possible without the JAM trinity.

JAM trinity has also created another opportunity in the space of data sciences. From a policy perspective, the government has been keen on experimenting with the utility of non-personalised data sets that can be availed by young entrepreneurs and other MSMEs.

Furthermore, as several ministries gather data from many programmes, policy making can be tweaked as per region and requirements. For instance, as data from the Ayushman Bharat programme increases exponentially in the 2020s, the local bodies and governments can go from a reactive model to a preventive one.

For digital governance in India to thrive, a robust foundation was essential, and the JAM trinity has provided just that. Today, as Modi had promised in 2014, governance of a billion people is about maximum governance, minimum government, minus the monetary leakages and middlemen corruption. Not 15 paise, but every rupee designated meant for the poor reaches them.

What is the Modi Government's vision of a circular economy?
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
‚Ä¢ India ranks seventh globally in Solid Waste Generation(SWG).
‚Ä¢ The present rate of SWG in India is 0.34 kg per capita per day, which is expected to increase to 0.7 kg per day by 2025.
‚Ä¢ India will generate 165 million tonnes of waste by 2030.
‚Ä¢ Out of 8 million tonnes of plastic waste in the world's oceans, the Meghna-Brahmaputra-Ganges river system dumps close to 73 thousand tons, making it the 6th most polluting river system contributing to marine plastic waste in the world.

These are some of India's shocking statistics regarding waste management.

India is well on track to become the third-largest economy in the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized that Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or 'Self-Reliant India, ' will be a launch pad that will put India on a high economic growth trajectory that is inclusive and sustainable. With Self-Relaint India, the aim is to make the country and its citizens independent, and the vision is firmly rooted in sustainability.
Moreover, the circular economy is no longer a choice for India. With a rising population, urbanization, environmental challenges and international commitments, shifting towards a circular economy has become imperative for India. To quote William Shakespeare, "This above all: to thine own self be true," which means "be true to yourself," has been the guiding principle of the Modi government development agenda. If India grows without following the principle of sustainability, then such growth would be fictitious, as it would be unsustainable. Therefore, India's economic development must align with the principles of circularity, eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerating nature.

"India is making the circular economy a major tool for urban development." Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Post-budget webinar speech, 2023.
The circular economy presents an economic approach focused on minimizing/eliminating wastage while promoting the optimal use or complete reuse of resources. It emphasizes the significance of embracing a holistic view of products and processes. India should embrace practices aligned with the principles of the circular economy to enhance industrial productivity, competitiveness and efficient use of the resources. Being a resource-intensive economy with a large and rapidly growing population, India has a vast potential to be a global leader in the Circular Economy.

India's adoption of a circular economy pathway could yield substantial environmental benefits and a reduction in congestion, thereby reducing pollution. This, in turn, has the potential to catalyze economic growth. Advancing towards a Circular Economy is vital given India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling the commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals regarding responsible consumption and production. The circular economy is also a key pillar of the Mission Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the global community, which aims to encourage individuals to adopt environmentally friendly sustainable lifestyles.

The significance of the Circular Economy, extended to producer responsibility and resource efficiency in achieving sustainable development, was underscored in the Delhi Declaration at the G20 Summit in 2023. This pivotal event saw the launch of the Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition (RECEIC), signifying a collective commitment to promoting environmentally friendly waste management, significantly reducing waste generation by 2030 and emphasizing the importance of zero-waste initiatives.

The Modi Government is spearheading the movement to push India towards a circular economy through an environment-friendly, sustainable economic policy framework while taking the country on a high growth rate trajectory. It has notified several rules, including the rules on Plastic Waste Management, e-waste Management, Construction and Demolition waste management, and policy on Metals Recycling to promote a circular economy.

NITI Aayog, a government think-tank, has recommended various initiatives to promote sustainable economic growth. To expedite India's transition from a linear to a circular economy, NITI Aayog has identified 11 focus areas in waste management. The focus areas include 11 end-of-life products, which continue to pose considerable challenges or are emerging as new areas that must be addressed holistically. Concrete steps have been suggested by this body to tackle challenges related to utilizing waste as a resource and to develop a comprehensive policy framework to develop an advanced recycling industry in India.

The principles of the circular economy agenda in municipal solid & liquid waste have received a significant push with the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The Mission is based on three fundamental principles or the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle). It has achieved remarkable success as India has enhanced its solid waste treatment capacity from 18% in 2014 to over 68%. Significant progress has been made in utilizing fly ash and slag generated in the steel industry and other sectors.

Switching to a circular economy has several advantages and vast potential to increase industry competitiveness, contribute to the GDP, and boost economic growth. By 2050, India's circular economy is projected to reach $2 trillion. It is also expected to create close to 10 million jobs by 2050, stated CII in its 'National Circular Economy Framework' (NCEF).

Transitioning to a circular economy requires macro-economic level planning and bringing various stakeholders on board. The Modi Government's vision is clear: Circular Economy is the need of the hour, and it advocates adopting the 7Rs of the circular economy, encompassing Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Redesign, Remanufacture, Refurbish, and Repair. These principles should guide the design of new ventures, business parks, and industrial clusters. With a stable and supportive policy ecosystem for a circular economy, India has the potential to emerge as a manufacturing powerhouse while fulfilling its commitment to climate change.

‚ÄúEk Bharat Sreshtha Bharat. GST stands for Good and Simple Tax. It is a path breaking legislation for New India. It‚Äôs a revolutionary taxation system for the digital India. GST is not just a tax reform, but it is a landmark step towards economic and social reforms‚Äù

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on rollout of Goods and Services Tax

Before July 1, 2017, the Indian indirect tax system was significantly fragmented, with both the Central and State governments independently imposing taxes on goods and services. Various taxes, such as excise duty, service tax, VAT, CST, purchase tax, entertainment tax, and octroi, contributed to this complexity. Additionally, there was a multitude of rates, laws, and procedures, leading to a substantial compliance burden.

Another challenge was the imposition of tax on tax, where VAT was applied to a value that already included excise duty, creating a cascading effect. This practice disrupted the input tax credit chain as goods moved across state borders, resulting in hidden costs for businesses. Moreover, pre-GST, tax checkpoints at inter-state borders created bottlenecks in the transportation of goods, leading to inefficiencies in the logistics sector and negatively affecting businesses.

Each state functioned as a distinct market for both industries and consumers, influencing the location decisions for factories and warehouses based more on the prevailing tax regime than on pure business considerations. This situation rendered the industry less competitive overall.

Hence, a significant milestone occurred on July 1, 2017, as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the most substantial tax overhaul, was launched within the confines of the Central Hall of Parliament. The implementation of GST eliminated the inefficiencies and complexities inherent in the outdated taxation system, contributing to an acceleration of economic growth.

GST has widened the tax base in India, increased tax-registered businesses, and brought certain unorganized sectors under the tax net.

GST has also contributed to the overall ease of doing business in India and simplified taxpayer compliance to a massive extent. The transparent nature of the tax system, with the digitization of processes and electronic records, helps in curbing tax evasion and increasing transparency. Additionally, GST has made business processes more efficient than ever by simplifying the tax structure.

In January 2024, India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection experienced a notable increase of 10.4%, reaching Rs 1.72 lakh crore, marking the second-highest monthly receipts since the inception of the GST regime. The highest-ever monthly GST collection was recorded in April 2023 at Rs 1.87 lakh crore.

The gross GST revenue for January 2024 was Rs 1,72,129 crore, reflecting a 10.4% year-on-year (YoY) growth compared to the Rs 155,922 crore collected in January 2023. This achievement stands as the second-highest monthly collection, marking the third month in the financial year 2023-24 with collections exceeding Rs 1.7 lakh crore.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections for micro enterprises in the financial years FY20 and FY21 amounted to Rs 2.2 lakh crore and Rs 2 lakh crore, respectively. However, in FY22, the collection increased to Rs 2.3 lakh crore, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In the case of small enterprises, GST payments remained steady at Rs 0.9 lakh crore in both FY20 and FY21 but saw growth to Rs 1 lakh crore in FY22. Similarly, for medium enterprises, GST payments declined from Rs 1.9 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 1.8 lakh crore in FY21 but rebounded to Rs 2 lakh crore in FY22.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST), implemented in India in July 2017 as a major overhaul to streamline and unify the nation's tax system, has left a substantial imprint on the Indian economy. According to a survey by Deloitte conducted in June 2023, 88% of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have reported a decrease in goods and services costs, coupled with streamlined supply chains.

The survey, which gathered 612 responses from both large enterprises and MSMEs across six industries, aimed to capture India Inc's perspectives on GST integration, ease of doing business, tax technology, investment-centric growth, taxpayer profiling, and recommendations. MSMEs credited the reduction in goods and services costs to the enhanced uniformity within the GST regime.

Several measures introduced under GST have proven beneficial for MSMEs, as reported by the survey respondents. Seventy-four percent acknowledged the positive impact of increasing the threshold limit for GST registration from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh. Similarly, 73% highlighted the advantages of relaxed thresholds and reduced restrictions for availing the composition scheme. Fifty-five percent found invoice financing solutions, based on GST-reported invoices, to be beneficial, while 46% appreciated the offline option for raising e-invoices without incurring any technology costs.

GST has opened up new avenues through quick bill discounting and loans to MSMEs. The Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) has been implemented. This has enableed entrepreneurs to access credit based on upcoming receivables

Enabled by the Goods and Services Tax Network, the ushering of this uniform tax has been critical for informal businesses which earlier could not access formal credit and other financial services. As India marches on to become a ten trillion dollar economy, it would have been important to factor in the development of over sixty million MSMEs in the country. With GST, not only staying outside the formal purview becomes counter-productive for small businesses, but also incentives them with ease of credit, as witnessed during the pandemic through the Emergency Credit Guarantee Line Scheme.

Goods and Service Tax has been a game changer when it comes to Centre and State relations. The One Nation One Tax reforms have indeed been a turning point of Indian Economy and its journey towards formalization.

Reviving Indian Temples

Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
India boasts a rich cultural heritage, an eternal journey through time, topography, and generations defined by diversity in terms of languages, art forms, traditions, and practices. The Modi government has brought much-needed change in the cultural sphere, bringing different communities together and imbibing a sense of patriotism in today's youth and old alike. There has been an unprecedented push towards the revival of long-forgotten traditions, neglected cultural values, and the restoration of monuments, which bears testimony to the significant landmark achievements of the current government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

From preserving and promoting our glorious history in the form of temples to making museums as centres for experiential learning and digitising manuscripts and museums, the government under PM Modi has introduced several initiatives to maintain and preserve our cultural assets in the last ten years. To transform India into a world-class destination for spiritual tourism, the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has undertaken several redevelopment and infrastructural projects.

With the inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in January 2024, a journey that began several centuries ago reached culmination. The inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya serves as a significant moment for millions of Hindus nationally and globally. In addition to its spiritual importance, the temple signifies the true devotion and sacrifices of thousands of citizens who tirelessly worked towards turning this dream into a reality. PM Modi‚Äôs emotional speech on the day of the temple‚Äôs inauguration bears the testimony to this fact when he said ‚Äì ‚ÄúRam is the faith of Bharat; Ram is the foundation of Bharat. Ram is the thought of Bharat; Ram is the constitution of Bharat. Ram is the consciousness of Bharat; Ram is the contemplation of Bharat. Ram is the pride of Bharat; Ram is the glory of Bharat. Ram is a continuous flow; Ram is an influence. Ram is an idea; Ram is also a policy. Ram is eternal, Ram is perpetual. Ram is pervasive, Ram is universal. Ram is the soul of the world. And therefore, when the consecration of Ram takes place, its impact is not just for years or centuries; its impact lasts for thousands of years.‚Äù These words of PM Modi were enough to bring goosebumps to every man who was listening to him live and online.

Some other prominent examples include revival of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, redevelopment of Kedarnath Dham, connecting Uttarakhand's Char Dham pilgrimage sites with all-weather roads, iconic Revival of Shri Ujjain Mahakal Temple Corridor and Facelift, cleaning and upkeep of several Ghats in Ganga under the Namami Gange Mission.

Because of PM Modi's perseverance and vision to progressively grow the religious tourism sector, India is seeing positive developments across the sector and the nation. There have been innumerable projects which have been revamped or redeveloped over a decade. Be it the laying of the foundation stone in Ayodhya in August 2020 or the inauguration of the transformed Mahakaleshwar Jyotirling Temple in Ujjain, PM Modi has always managed to link the people of the nation with the faith along with preserving the sanctity of the traditions and the nation's civilisational values.

Along with the redevelopment of Kedarnath, the Modi government took the initiative of linking the four sites of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath through the Char Dham Pariyojana under which the construction of all-weather roads connecting the four pilgrimage sites have been taken up. In another project, the government planned to link Rishikesh with Karnaprayag via a railway line, which will likely be operational by 2025.

In 2017, PM Modi unveiled the 112-feet-tall lord Adiyogi Shiva statue in Coimbatore and brought yoga to the fore, bringing together the nation's citizens to build a better and spiritually healthy Bharat. In 2021, a revamped Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi was inaugurated by Narendra Modi. PM Modi also inaugurated the Somnath seaside promenade, and his government led the initiative to reconstruct the temple precinct of Old (Juna) Somnath. After the annulment of Article 370, the government under PM Modi launched renovation works at several temple complexes in the Valley, including Srinagar.

Through the Char Dham project, the government aims to provide all-weather connectivity to four holy towns in the state ‚Äî Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. The project includes 825 km of national highways connecting Uttarakhand state. By September 2023, of the 825 kilometres, about 601 km will have been completed. The project, costing over Rs 11,700 crore, which was initially expected to be completed by March 2020, is now scheduled to be completed by December 2024.

The year 2022 saw many landmark achievements in the cultural sphere. The unveiling of the 216-feet-tall Statue of Equality in Hyderabad commemorating the 11th-century Bhakti Saint Ramanujacharya and PM Modi's visit to Pavagadh Hill in Gujarat, along with laying the foundation stone of a redeveloped temple of the Kalika Mata. Recently, in 2024, another project has been launched by PM Modi, Kamakhya Divyalok Pariyojana, a project aimed at boosting tourism in Assam.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also initiated the establishment of temples abroad, not just in Bharat alone. In 2018, he unveiled the inaugural Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. A year later, he initiated the revitalisation project for the 200-year-old Lord Sri Krishna Shreenathji temple in Bahrain. In 2024, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the Swaminarayan temple of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi, a magnificent temple which looks splendid with its architecture adorned with pink sandstone.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landmark initiatives, which range from promoting Indian traditions to reviving India's cultural heritage, have not only changed the socio-economic landscape of the nation but also earned the nation due respect and accolades from world institutions and leaders. PM Modi's goal for cultural preservation and revival has been a source of inspiration for one and all. It has been proven to be a catalyst for bringing people from diverse backgrounds together, bridging boundaries, encompassing terrains and enhancing the world's cultural environment.

Viksit Bharat: The Vision of PM Modi
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
"Today, every institution and every individual should move with a resolution that every effort and act will be for Viksit Bharat. The aim of your goals, your resolutions should be only one ‚Äì Developed India".-PM Narendra Modi, At the launch of Viksit Bharat @2047: Voice of Youth.'


Viksit Bharat, or Developed India, is the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and represents a complete blueprint for the country's prosperity, not just a catchphrase. This vision will be a guiding principle for India during its Amrit Kaal. With a combination of social changes, technical innovations, and economic reforms, Prime Minister Modi hopes to raise India's position at the global level. This vision has many components, from economic growth to all-inclusive development and imbibing technological innovation.

A key objective of Viksit Bharat is to enable every citizen to participate in the economy. The economy that PM Modi envisions is strong, inclusive, and full of job and entrepreneurial opportunities. This entails implementing policies to encourage investment, advance economic growth, and foster innovation across various industries. The government's dedication to creating an environment favourable for business expansion and employment generation is demonstrated by the focus on programmes such as Made in India, Digital India, and Startup India. With the support of digitisation, homegrown manufacturing, and a thriving startup community, Prime Minister Modi hopes to raise millions out of poverty and realise the nation's full economic potential.

Another crucial component of Viksit Bharat's vision is to develop world-class infrastructure to promote sustainable growth and improve everyone's standard of living. To close infrastructure gaps around the country, the government is launching large-scale projects that range from constructing world-class roads, trains, and ports to increasing digital connection and updating urban infrastructure. Projects like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and Smart Cities Mission highlight the government's commitment to building livable, sustainable cities, enhancing connectivity, and offering affordable housing to everybody. Vande Bharat trains, the UDAN initiative, has made the travel experience hassle-free for common citizens. Similarly, the expansion of metro trains has also ensured a smooth travel experience within cities. PM Modi wants to increase productivity, unleash economic potential, and raise the general standard of living through infrastructure investment.

Viksit Bharat prioritises inclusive development and social welfare to ensure everyone benefits from economic progress. The administration has launched several landmark initiatives to support disadvantaged populations, empower marginalised communities, and expand social security, healthcare, and education. Programmes such as Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana indicate the government's dedication to enhancing healthcare, financial inclusion, gender parity, and sanitation. PM Modi wants to build a more inclusive and equal society where all people can prosper, and he accomplishes this by placing greater importance on social welfare. Initiatives such as Jan Aushandu Kendras were able to save 30,000 crore rupees for individuals from poor and middle-class families by providing medicines at an 80% discount rate.

Concerning environmental sustainability, Viksit Bharat aims to make India greener and cleaner. The government has started programmes to encourage renewable energy use, water conservation, and cleanliness, including the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission, and National Solar Mission. On a global level, PM Modi has endorsed sustainable development principles and the International Solar Alliance. The government aims to reduce environmental problems and create a sustainable future for future generations; thus, it supports conservation initiatives, climate-resilient infrastructure, and renewable energy. India is dedicated to upholding internationally acknowledged environmental standards and aims to achieve approximately fifty per cent of its installed electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

One of the key pillars of PM Modi's Viksit Bharat rests on harnessing technology to enhance efficiency and transparency in governance. Through platforms like Aadhaar and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), the government has streamlined the distribution of subsidies and welfare benefits, reduced leakages, and ensured that assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries directly. TDBT helped the government eliminate ten crore fraudulent entries and successfully curbed financial leakages. DBT has saved nearly 3 lakh crore rupees from falling into the wrong hands in the country. Additionally, schemes like Ayushman Bharat have utilised technology to create a digital health infrastructure, enabling citizens easy and hassle-free access to healthcare services. Overall, the government's emphasis on leveraging technology for welfare purposes underscores its commitment to inclusive development and empowerment of all citizens.

Inspired by PM Modi's vision of Viksit Bharat, India is making remarkable progress in every sector. Whether being the first nation to land on the moon's south pole or poised to become the world's third-largest economy, India is undeniably ascending on the path of development. The increasing cultural revival through programs such as the PRASHAD scheme and the Swadesh Darshan scheme ensures that Indian culture has garnered widespread popularity on the global stage.

PM Modi's vision of Viksit Bharat is based on an ambitious and groundbreaking plan to achieve India's full potential and propel the country to unprecedented development and prosperity. To establish a more resilient and inclusive society where Janbhagidari is the basis of the nation's success story. In addition, the government focuses on infrastructural development, social welfare, economic empowerment, and environmental sustainability.

Viksit Assam: Paving the Path to Peace and Prosperity
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
After decades of strife and turmoil, Assam emerges as a beacon of progress, aligning itself with the developmental strides of other Indian states. Assam has transformed its trajectory from a history of underdevelopment and violence, becoming a driving force for progress in the region. Formerly misguided youths are now integral members of mainstream society, actively contributing to Assam's journey towards becoming a development hub.

Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the government's focused initiatives have not only shifted the state's fate but have also unlocked its vast potential for development. PM Modi's visits to the state have brought a cascade of gifts, propelling Assam into an era of comprehensive development. From inaugurating seven cancer hospitals in a day to unleashing over 14,000 crore worth of development projects in one sweep , each visit has marked a significant leap forward for the state since 2014.

Peace and Prosperity Prevails
After enduring the worst of insurgent activities, Assam has embarked on a new era of peace since 2014. Several peace agreements have been inked by the Modi government, putting an emphatic end to insurgency and terrorism in the state. Whether it's the transformative Bodo Peace Accord of 2020 or the signed peace deal with the pro-talk faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), each agreement marks a historic turning point, promising enduring peace for the state.

Among the peace initiatives, the Bodo Accord signed on January 27, 2020, put a full stop to a five-decade-old Bodo issue in Assam and resulted in the surrender of 1615 cadres with a huge cache of arms and ammunition. After the accord, the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) was constituted. The ripple effect of the accord is evident across all strata of BTR society. Notably, a pivotal commitment of the accord‚Äîthe establishment of Kokrajhar Medical College‚Äîhas materialized, with its inaugural MBBS batch commencing in 2023, marking a significant milestone. In addition, with its initiatives, the government has already rehabilitated 2774 ex-cadres from the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) in 2021. Steps were taken to rehabilitate former NDFB insurgents.

To resolve the long-running dispute in the Karbi regions of Assam, the Karbi Anglong Agreement was signed on September 04, 2021, in which more than 1000 armed cadres renounced violence and returned to mainstream society. Another agreement with delegates from 8 Adivasi Groups on September 15, 2022, marked resolving the long-standing crisis affecting Adivasis and tea garden workers in Assam. Consequently, 1182 members of Adivasi groups have transitioned into the mainstream by relinquishing their weapons.

Two inter-state agreements were signed to ensure greater peace and conflict-free relations with the neighbouring states of Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. The Assam-Meghalaya Boundary Agreement (March 2022) settles 65% of disputes, while the Assam-Arunachal Border Agreement (April 2023) concluded a 700+ km border resolution.

Greater Connectivity
Assam, nestled in the northeastern corner of India, grappled with connectivity challenges that impacted its socio-economic development. The Brahmaputra River, a lifeline for the state, poses both a resource and a barrier for mobility in the absence of physical bridges. Since 2014, the government has actively enhanced Assam's connectivity, exemplified by the Bogibeel and Dhola Sadia Bridges.

These engineering marvels not only link regions but also stimulate economic ecosystems. The Bogibeel Bridge has significantly reduced train travel distance between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by 80% and has fostered economic growth while attracting industrial investments. It has particularly spurred economic activities in flood-prone districts like Lakhimpur and Dhemaji, prompting the Assam government to inaugurate projects worth Rs 1220.21 crore in Dhemaji district in 2022. This bridge has become a lifeline for lakhs of people in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

Initiated by PM Modi in 2021, the Mahabahu Brahmaputra project has transformed connectivity and development along the riverbanks. Ro-Pax vessel services between Neamati-Majuli Island, North Guwahati-South Guwahati, and Dhubri-Hatsingimari, along with the establishment of the IWT Terminal at Jogighopa and tourist jetties on the Brahmaputra, not only boosted the economy but also attracted tourists from India and abroad. Majuli, once a victim of flood-induced erosion, overcame connectivity woes with an 8 km bridge linking Kalibari Ghat to Jorhat (under construction phase) . The operationalization of this bridge will not only connect thousands of families in Majuli and cut travel time to Lakhimpur and Jorhat to a mere 30 minutes.

In addition to water links, Assam is seamlessly integrated into the world-class Vande Bharat Rail Network. The inaugural run of Assam's first Vande Bharat Express, connecting Guwahati to New Jalpaiguri in 2023, promises enhanced travel convenience, substantial advantages for students, and a boost to job opportunities in tourism and business. In addition, there has been a four-fold increase in the railway budget to Northeast India since 2014.

Development Push
Over the past nine years, Assam has witnessed a surge in development initiatives, marking a shift from Look East to Act East policy endeavours. Despite being labelled the Cancer Capital of India and grappling with inadequate medical infrastructure, a beacon of hope emerged in 2022 with the inauguration of 7 cancer hospitals in a single day by PM Modi. Additionally, Assam takes pride in being home to the first AIIMS in Northeast India.

PM's April 2023 visit to Assam witnessed the announcement of over 14,000 crores in development initiatives, with the inauguration and foundation laying of projects totalling more than Rs. 10,900 crores. Highlights include the foundation stone for a Brahmaputra River bridge connecting Palashbari and Sualkuchi, commissioning a 500 TPD Methanol plant in Namrup, Dibrugarh, and inaugurating five railway projects, including section doubling and electrification across the region. Indeed, every time the PM visits Assam, the state is showered with development push.

Favoured Destination for Tourists
Once overlooked, Assam's abundant natural beauty has now seen a surge of tourists. Notably, the state has witnessed an impressive 575 percent growth in tourist arrivals during 2022‚Äì2023, surpassing one crore visitors. It marks a significant milestone for Assam's thriving tourism industry. The announcement of Maa Kamakhya Corridor has garnered wider attention, and in the coming days, it will boost the state's tourism sector. Assam's Jorhat and Kokrajhar are among 15 destinations in the Northeast selected for development under Swadesh Darshan 2.0.

Promoting and Preserving Unique Culture
With Prime Minister Modi making over 50 visits and Union Ministers conducting more than 400 visits to the region, the Northeast has become an integral part of the PM's push to maintain the region's tradition and culture.

The Modi government, committed to honouring India's unsung heroes, paid tribute to Bir Lachit Borphukan on his 400th birth anniversary in 2022. During PM Modi's April 2023 visit to Assam, the foundation stone was laid for the beautification of Rang Ghar in Sivasagar. The project aims to enhance tourist amenities, featuring a fountain show, a boat house for adventurous rides, an artisan village, and more, showcasing the rich history of the Ahom dynasty.

By acknowledging and elevating the status of tribal heroes in the region, the government has effectively demonstrated that Northeast India is no longer relegated to neglect within the country.
PM Modi has also brought Assam's culture to global prominence. From participating in the Guinness record-breaking Bihu celebration in Assam in 2023 to donning the Gamocha at the UN HQ lawn on International Yoga Day, the Prime Minister actively promotes the cultural heritage of Assam on the global stage. In the 'Mann Ki Baat episodes,' PM Modi has woven a tapestry of inspiring tales from Assam. From applauding Tisso's dedicated work in preserving the Karbi language in the Karbi Anglong district to the uplifting narrative of rickshaw puller Ahmad Ali, who built nine schools for underprivileged students, these stories resonate with and inspire people nationwide.

The Modi government has replaced the neglectful approach of earlier governments with a more nurturing one. A transformation in mindset has become evident, eliminating the once common questions like 'Where is Assam?' or 'Is Assam part of India?' The broader acceptance witnessed today was a notable miss a decade ago. All this resulted in a tourism boost. In a region that has been neglected for far too long, the people of the Northeast have now found a new sense of hope and optimism.

Several key projects have been completed, contributing to the state's economic growth and modernization. These projects encompass various sectors, including ports, railways, highways, airports, agricultural infrastructure, and higher education. Additionally, PM Modi's visits to cultural centres in Tamil Nadu have underscored the state's rich heritage and historical significance.

The farmers of Tamil Nadu have also benefitted through various schemes such as PM Kisan, PM Fasal Bima Yojana and PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana. An area of 10.98 Lakh hectares has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the State of Tamil Nadu through the PDMC scheme with the release of Central Assistance of Rs. 2,365 crore.

To ensure that the youth are future-ready, programs such as PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana have been effective in the state. Rs. 22.54 crore has been utilized in the last three years to develop skills among the youth . The introduction of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) witnessed the students of Tamil Nadu bagging the top 50 ranks, which provides a level playing field for the students in the states in entrance exams.

PM Modi has visited several temples in Tamil Nadu, emphasizing the state's rich cultural heritage and historical significance. These visits have highlighted the importance of preserving and promoting the state's diverse cultural legacy. Cultural programs such as Kashi Tamil Sangamam helped rejuvenate the cultural connection between Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. PM Modi also had made several visits to various temples across the state:-

Srirangam Temple: PM Modi worshipped at Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam in Tiruchi, ahead of the Pran Pratishtha of Sri Ram Lalla at the Ayodhya temple.

Additionally, PM Modi presented the Sengol, a symbol of India's independence, to the Newly constructed Parliament of India during the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022

Tamil Nadu has experienced significant infrastructure development under PM Modi, with key projects spanning ports, railways, highways, airports, and agricultural infrastructure. Additionally, the state has seen an increase in the purchase of agricultural goods, underscoring its growing contribution to the farming sector. PM Modi's visits to cultural centres in Tamil Nadu have further emphasized the state's rich cultural heritage and historical significance, contributing to its overall development and recognition.

Transforming Lives: Narendra Modi's Holistic Approach to Empower Backward Classes in India
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs approach has shown a transformative journey which fosters an inclusive development model and empower the marginalised communities. Upliftment of the backward classes is central which includes Schedule Castes (SC), Schedules Tribes and Some Vulnerable Tribal Groups. Modi government attempts to foster inclusive development through a series of targeted policies, schemes and inititatives.


Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are among the most marginalized communities. And they require special attention and support by the government. Due to this Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission was launched by the Modi government in 2023 with a budget of 24000 crore. The aim was to enhance the socio-economic conditions of PVTGs by providing safe housing, education, drinking water and sustainable livelihood opportunities.


On similar lines Prime Minister Narendra Modi also initiated the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra on Janjatiya Gaurav Divas which is the Birth anniversary of tribal leader Birsa Munda. The purpose of this yatra was to raise awareness and provide information about different government welfare programs in tribal areas. 2.55 million Gram Panchayats and 3600 urban local authorities were covered by Janurary 25,2024. The government through these initiatives aimed to address specific tribal concerns like healthcare initiatives like Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission and scholarship Programs


Along with that there were schemes aimed at improving the lives of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). These includes PM-Gram Sadak Yojana and PM-Gram Awas Yojana. These provided basic infrastructure and affordable housing in rural areas which are inhabited by SCs and STs. In order to provide clean drinking water Jal Jeewan Mission was initiated. Along with that, Ayushman Bharat and PMJAY offer financial security for healthcare expenses. Food security is ensured by Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and economic empowerment is promoted through initiatives like Deeendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission due to which backward classes got the chance to become self-employed.


Realising the need for education in uplifting backward classes and breaking the cycle of poverty, Modi led government has launched initiatives to increase access to education opportunities for the SCs, STs and other marginalised communities. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) aims to provide quality education to children belonging to SC, ST and Minority communities.Likewise the National Fellowship for Scheduled Caste students (NFSCS) provides assistance to SC students who are pursuing higher education. Along with that youth is getting employed through Skill India Mission.


There is Stand-up India scheme that has been launched by Modi government which aims to provide financial assistance and support to SC,ST and women entrepreneurs by providing bank loans for starting new business. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides financial assistance to Micro and small enterprises owned by individuals from backward classes.
Healthcare for backward classes is provided through Ayushman Bharat Scheme known as Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.


Modi‚Äôs holistic approach reflects a comprehensive strategy which aims to diminish the socio-economic disparities. There are policies and welfare schemes for the SCs, STs and other backward classes.

PM Modi's Decade-Long Commitment to Waste Management
February 24, 2024
Share




Join PM Modi on WhatsApp
"We should always consider waste as a resource and wealth‚Ä¶do not see it as just garbage. Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management."
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi

In the past nine years, the Modi government has demonstrated unwavering commitment and innovative initiatives towards waste management, steering India towards a cleaner and more sustainable future. With a comprehensive approach encompassing policy reforms, technological advancements, and community engagement, the government has successfully laid the groundwork for a paradigm shift in waste management practices.


Some striking initiatives in this regard are the Swachh Bharat Mission, the ban on single-use plastic, new extended producer responsibility guidelines, and the Smart Cities Mission.


At the forefront of the government's waste management efforts is the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched in 2014 with the vision of achieving a clean and open-defecation-free India. This flagship program has transformed sanitation practices and played a pivotal role in instilling a sense of responsibility and awareness regarding waste disposal. Rural India today is 100% open-defecation-free.

Rural sanitation coverage increased from 39% in 2014 to 100% in 2019.


The Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBARdhan) scheme under Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen Phase-II was launched in 2023 to aid villages in scientific management of organic waste, including agricultural residues and cattle waste, effectively laying down a pathway for 'waste to wealth'. The scheme provides financial assistance of up to Rs. 50 lakh per district to set up community biogas plants in villages and blocks at the district level. The GOBARdhan scheme boosts the rural economy and secures environmental sustainability via a 'whole of government' approach. To date, 536 compressed biogas plants and 1,193 biogas plants have registered on the GOBARdhan portal.


With a vision of creating 'Garbage Free Cities', the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) 2.0 was initiated in 2021. The mission entails door-to-door collection, source segregation, and municipal solid waste scientific processing. Rs. 1,41,678 crore have been allocated for five years from 2021-2026 for the mission with its focus on single-use plastic, segregation of waste, and reduction in air pollution through management of construction activities and bio-remediation of dump sites. In addition, the solid waste processing capacity has also enhanced by around 1,05,876 TPD in the last eight years under the SBM (Urban).


The government has introduced separate guidelines for environmentally safe and sound management of plastic, solid, biomedical, E-waste, and other hazardous waste. This, coupled with relevant waste management rules and levy against environmental damages based on the polluter pays principle, ensures that waste management in India is dealt with.


The government introduced new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines wherein the producer is held responsible for collecting, recycling and disposing of the wastes generated by their products. It shifts the burden of waste management from the government or taxpayers to producers. It also encourages producers to adopt eco-friendly packaging and waste reduction measures. Since 2022, EPR has utilised varied market mechanisms for environmentally sound waste management, including plastic waste, e-waste, used oil, and battery waste.


Single-use plastic items with low utility and high littering potential have been banned in India since July 2022 via the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2021. Further, online platforms like the National Dashboard, which monitors the implementation of a comprehensive action plan, and the CPCB Monitoring Module for Compliance on Elimination of Single-Use Plastic were also utilised to monitor the ban effectively. This step aligns with global efforts to curb plastic pollution and demonstrates the government's endorsement of sustainable practices.


Started with an outlay of Rs. 17,15 crore , the National Bioenergy Programme aims to recover energy from surplus waste‚Äîbiomass, cattle dung, and urban and industrial biowaste‚Äîto promote bioenergy in India as we work to achieve our ambitious renewable energy targets along with securing aatmanirbharta in the energy sector. It supports setting up bioenergy plants with the central government's financial assistance. The programme includes sub-schemes such as the Waste-to-Energy Programme and Biogas Programme.


The Waste-to-Energy scheme, in particular, provides financial assistance for setting up large biogas and bioCNG plants, among others, between 2021-22 and 2025-26. It aims to recover energy from industrial, urban, agricultural, and municipal solid waste.


Under the National Bioenergy Programme umbrella, 12,693 small biogas plants were installed in 2023. An annual target of 46,000 small biogas plant installations has been allocated during FY2024.


Going further, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) promotes the production of compressed biogas in the country for use in vehicles, industries, and cooking. The scheme encourages entrepreneurs to set up bioCNG plants to produce and supply bioCNG to oil marketing companies for sale as automotive fuels.


These initiatives lay down a comprehensive framework for effective waste management in the country. In addition, government programs like the Smart City Mission incorporate waste management as a key component of urban development. By integrating technology and data-driven solutions, the government aims to create efficient waste management systems in cities, setting the stage for a cleaner and more sustainable urban landscape.


In conclusion, the Modi government's tireless efforts towards waste management over the past nine years have yielded significant results. Through a multi-faceted approach encompassing policy reforms, technological advancements, and community engagement, the government has addressed immediate challenges and laid the groundwork for a sustainable and cleaner India. As we move forward, we must acknowledge these positive strides and continue supporting initiatives contributing to a greener and more environmentally conscious nation.
